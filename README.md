# Lemmings.js
This is a Lemmings Clone/Remake using only HTML5 / Javascript. It uses the original .dat Files of the DOS game. No converting of Images and Levels is required.

This is a work in progress and at the moment you can't play the game. Use the URL Fragment identifier (#) to select a Level (LevelFile * 100 + LevelIndexInFile) e.g. /lemmings.js/main.html#901 for the Level-File 9 and the second (01) Level in the file.
